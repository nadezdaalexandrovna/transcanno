### Branches

VersionUsedSummer2018 is the version of Transc&Anno used to transcribe the SMS collection.

The development branch contains the latest version of Transc&Anno where I tried to take into account most of the wishes I received from the 
users of VersionUsedSummer2018. In this version the database was modified. It means that a collection transcribed with the VersionUsedSummer2018 cannot be directly uploaded into this new version.
